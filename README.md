# Click-Through-Rate-CTR-Prediction

Embarking on a mission to improve the forecast of click-through rates in the ever-changing realm of internet advertising, motivated by a strong feeling of purpose and determination.

# Introduction

The foundation of CTR prediction lies in the analysis of vast volumes of historical user interactions with online ads. The knowledge gained from these interactions enables advertisers, ad platforms, and content providers to tailor their offerings to individual preferences, thereby increasing user engagement and the overall effectiveness of ad campaigns. The capacity to forecast user behaviour, specifically the likelihood of engaging on advertisements, has become the most important attribute of digital advertising. This project undertakes a comprehensive investigation of CTR prediction using predictive models, revealing the complexities of machine learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning techniques used to uncover the potential of predicting user responses to online advertising.


# Aim

* To increase efficacy of advertising online using advanced machine learning techniques, ensemble learning and deep learning, create a predictive model that can accurately estimate user click-through rates (CTR) based on historical data.

* Perform a thorough comparison of classical machine learning models, ensemble machine learning models, and deep learning models using a variety of evaluation metrics.

* Perform in-depth analyses of multiple predictive methodologies and compare their performance to predetermined metrics.

* Informed by empirical evidence, provide actionable insights and recommendations for selecting the most appropriate analytical approach to predict online ad click-through rates.


# Dataset Selection and Source

The primary dataset utilized for this research was the Avazu Dataset, which contains exclusively nonhuman data related to online advertisements. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. The data required for this endeavour included, but was not limited to, the following aspects of online advertisements:

Banner Position: Information regarding the placement of a banner ad on a website or app screen.

Site Category: Categorization of the website or app where the advertisement was displayed.

Site Domain: The website or domain hosting the advertisement.

App Category: The category of the app in which the advertisement was displayed.

Device Connection Type: The type of connection used by the device when the ad was viewed.

# PROJECT ARCHITECTURE

The project's design is adaptable and scalable to ensure its functionality and maintainability. It consists of three major components: 

**Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing:** This component handles the collection of the Avazu Dataset, data preprocessing duties including data cleansing and feature engineering, and the preparation of the dataset for model training. 

**Model Selection:** For standard machine learning, Logistic Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent (LR-SGD) was used. For ensemble learning, I used Gradient Boosting Decision Trees with Feedforward Neural Network (GBDT+FNN), and for deep learning, DeepFM was used. The construction of each model is made with performance and expansion in mind. 

**Evaluation and Analysis:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve are the measures that can be used to assess a model's efficacy.

# Conclusion

This project has contributed to the ongoing efforts to refine click-through rate prediction in online advertising. By embracing a diverse array of techniques and methodologies, I have not only expanded my knowledge but also equipped myself with valuable tools for future endeavours. The journey toward more accurate, efficient, and adaptive solutions in click-through rate prediction continues, and this project marks a significant milestone in that pursuit.

**Software Environment Details**

**Development Platforms:** To facilitate efficient coding, Google Colab and Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Jupyter Notebook 
were utilised to develop the project.

**Python Libraries:** Several Python libraries, including renowned ones like deepctr, tensorflow, and scikeras, were utilised.

**Machine Learning and Deep Learning Tools:** Key tools and libraries included sklearn, GradientBoostingClassifier, SGDClassifier, DeepFM, and other essential components
